# Final-Project

HOW TO

All of the code in this function runs pretty self explanatory

If you want to plot a bunch of points you'll input corresponding x and y values in order in the x value and y value boxes. These should be in a comma separated list

To change any of the titles on the graph you need to place the new title in the corresponding box and click return

if you want to cahnge the color and line type of the graph you need to click on the line type you want first and then the color. The graph should then output the correct combination.

To run the lab in general, you just need to click run at the top of the window
